          <h3>Correlations Between Health Risks and Income</h3>
          <p>Based on the above charts, it appears that there is a direct correlation between health risk factors, household income, and poverty. 
              The data shows that less affluent states have higher obesity rates and has increased likelihood to smoke. 
              The states with higher household income has generally better healthcare coverage, lower obesity rate, and less likely to smoke. 
              The chart shows outliers, which indicates that my assumption is not absolute. 
              For example, North Dakota and Delaware has relatively high median household income, but with high obesity rates. </p>

          <h3>Correlations Between Health Risks and Age</h3>
          <p>Based on the above chart, it is unclear whether there is a correlation between health risk and age. The median ages in most US states are between 
              36-40 years old. The lack of range in median age clustered the visualization making them more difficult to analyze. However, we can draw conclusion if we analyze the data by state. 
              For example, Texas has a median age of 34, has the highest % lacking healthcare, likelihood to smoke is lower than most states, and in the obesity rate is above most states. 
              California's median age is 36, with high healthcare coverage, the smoking and obesity rate is lower than most states. 
              It appears that there is more of a correlation between healthcare coverage and healthrisks than the age.</p>
